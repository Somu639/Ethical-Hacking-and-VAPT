Description: The security tester should follow the standard process of VA and PT, document the test results, and align the process to the below-mentioned stages:

 

Information Gathering and Reconnaissance
Scanning and Enumeration
Vulnerability Assessment
Exploitation
Analysis and Reporting
 

Tools required: Kali Linux, Windows 10, and Debian System

 

Expected deliverables: The customer leadership team is expecting two types of reports from the security testing organization:

Executive report: The customer wants a short report with a summary of the assessment and key risks, findings from the executive dashboard, and areas of improvement. The report should be non-technical and comprehend the risk view if exploited. This audience for the report is the senior leadership of the customer organization.

Technical report: This report is intended for sharing with the customerâ€™s technical team. The objective of the report is to provide details:

Vulnerabilities identified
Exploitable and non-exploitable vulnerabilities
Exploitation evidence (screenshot and proof-of-concept video)
Remediation suggestion
